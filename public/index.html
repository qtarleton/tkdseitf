              Tae-Kyon is a form of foot fighting. Through the centuries,
              hand techniques were introduced and the combination is now
              called Taekwon-Do, but in the more advanced techniques, the
              use of the legs is still more important. This makes Taekwon-Do
              more effective and spectacular than other oriental
              self-defense arts, because the legs can develop more power and
              reach farther than the hands. The Korean word "Tae" means
              kicking, jumping, stepping or flying of the feet; "Kwon" means
              punching, striking or beating of the hands or fists; and "Do"
              means art, technique or way.
            </p>
            <p>
              
              TaeKwon-Do training is divided into four parts:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Basic
              fundamental exercise 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Basic blocks and punches </li>
                    <li>Basic
                      stances and kicks </li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  Pattern - A memorized series of moves for
              self-sparring practice. Affords practice in defending yourself
              in all directions against multiple attackers. Pattern develops
              patience and improves concentration by the process of
              bilaterally exercising both hemispheres of the brain.
              Concentration is the foundation of our entire learning system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sparring - is a competitive sport requiring speed,
              accuracy, balance, coordination, endurance and judgment. You
              will learn to use combinations of offense and defense
              techniques in rapid succession. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>One-step sparring or
                      guaranteed sparring. </li>
                    <li>Free-sparring </li>

                  Self-defense
                      techniques - are applied to all personal attack situations.
                      Emphasis is on effective blocking techniques which resist an
                      attack, turning the attacker's strength and momentum against
                      himself.

              Self-defense dates as far back as human history. Humans always
              felt a need for protection against nature's animals and other
              humans. In Korea, several thousand years ago, a form of
              self-defense was started in the Buddha Temple. Monks practiced
              Buddhism many hours a day. They realized a need for exercise
              and self-defense for protection from robbers and looters.
              Since Buddha philosophy does not permit the use of weapons in
              the temple, their only source of protection was the use of
              their bare hands and feet. Thus came the invention of a few
              very brief self defense techniques. Along with the yoga that
              was practiced, these techniques were found to be very good
              exercise as well as a means of protection.
            </p>
            <p>
              1300 years ago during the Silla Dynasty, there was a very
              select group of youths called Wha Rang Do, who attended what
              is similar to our military schools. They adopted these
              self-defense techniques as their basic army military training.
              They called their techniques Tae-Kyon. These were then taught
              by word of mouth down through the generations.
